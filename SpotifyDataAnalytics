# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

Project: Analyzing Spotify Song Features and Recommendations

Objective:  Analyze a dataset of Spotify song features and identify trends and insights within the data.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

Data Exploration: 

# Retrieve the total number of songs in the dataset:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_songs FROM Spotifydata;
Result: 50

# Identify the top 10 artists with the highest average track popularity:
SELECT artist_name, avg(popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY artist_name DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Find the top 10 artists with the highest average track popularity:
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Finding the average popularity of the top artists
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
 
SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;

TRENDS AND INSIGHTS

# Analyze the distribution of tracks across different keys:
SELECT song_key, COUNT(*) AS num_tracks
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY song_key
ORDER BY num_tracks DESC;

#Determine the most common time signature in the dataset:
SELECT time_signature, COUNT(*) AS num_occurrences
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY time_signature
ORDER BY num_occurrences DESC
LIMIT 1;
